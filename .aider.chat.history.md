#### Tell me what you see in my project  

Based on the files you've added, I see the following:

*   **Rust Project:** This is a Rust project, indicated by the `Cargo.toml` and `src/main.rs` files.
*   **Dioxus Framework:** The project uses the Dioxus framework, a React-like library for building user interfaces in Rust, as seen in `Cargo.toml` and the `use dioxus::prelude::*;` and `dioxus::launch(App);` lines in `src/main.rs`.
*   **Web Application:** It appears to be primarily a web application, configured by the `[features]` section in `Cargo.toml` and the `[web.app]` section in `Dioxus.toml`.
*   **Basic Structure:** The project has a standard structure with `src/` for source code and `assets/` for static files.
*   **Assets:** It includes a favicon (`assets/favicon.ico`), a main CSS file (`assets/main.css`), and an SVG header image (`assets/header.svg`).
*   **Main Component:** The main application component is defined in `src/main.rs` as the `App` function, which renders some HTML elements including a title, an image, and two buttons.
*   **Styling:** The `assets/main.css` file provides basic styling for the body and some specific IDs (`#hero`, `#links`, `#header`).
*   **Configuration:** `Dioxus.toml` sets the web application title and includes the `assets` directory.
*   **Dependency Management:** `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` manage the project's dependencies, primarily Dioxus and its related crates.
*   **Git Ignore:** The `.gitignore` file is set up to ignore standard Rust build outputs and macOS specific files.
*   **README:** The `README.md` provides basic instructions for development, specifically how to serve the application using `dx serve`.

In summary, it's a simple Dioxus web application project with basic structure, styling, and configuration.

#### please add aider to gitignore  

Okay, I can add `aider` to your `.gitignore` file.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for that:

.gitignore
````
<<<<<<< SEARCH
# These are backup files generated by rustfmt
**/*.rs.bk
=======
# These are backup files generated by rustfmt
**/*.rs.bk

aider
>>>>>>> REPLACE
````
